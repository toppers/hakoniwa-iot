The concept of Hakoniwa is 
Put mixed things as you like, 
and try various concepts with ease !
We provide a virtual environment, 
which makes it easy to combine and 
demonstrate different software and 
services when developing IoT, 
automated driving systems, 
cloud robotics systems, etc.
We envision a use scenario 
where engineers from diverse fields 
gather to develop IoT systems.
The box simulates the events and 
states of complex federated IoT systems 
according to the desired scenario. 
And, by just replacing the assets 
that are the system components of Hakoniwa, 
the user can arbitrarily change the validation's 
target / abstraction level / accuracy.
For your information, the origin of Hakoniwa is 
one of the traditional Japanese cultures 
in which various elements such as small trees, 
dolls, bridges, and boats are arranged 
in a miniature garden in a small box to recreate a picturesque scene.
